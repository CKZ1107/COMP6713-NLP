[SEP] The media is really pushing hard for their big money clients for $tsla options tomorrow. The sh!t they make up is laughable. Even @SquawkCNBC @JoeSquawk hitting a new low. Does anyone care who sells stock a year ago? Buffett sold $aapl last year too. Talk about that. [SEP] In 2020, Tim Cook, CEO of $AAPL, earned $265,000,000 in total compensation. In 2020, Warren Buffett earned ~$755,079,143 in dividends from $AAPL. ZERO hours clocked, ZERO meetings & ZERO headaches caused. Invest. [SEP] This thread is just a broad overview of the balance sheet Want specifics & and a helpful example? We did a deep dive into the balance sheet on my YouTube channel using $AAPL's recent numbers as an example [URL] [SEP] All about this trendline now on $AAPL, continuing to reject it.
